### Drawing 01: Foundation Plan

**Intended Scale:** 1/2" = 1'-0"

**Description:** This drawing shows a top-down view of the gazebo foundation, detailing the placement and dimensions of support post footings and the optional concrete slab.

**Elements to Include:**

1.  **Overall Footprint:** Clearly outline the 10'-0" x 10'-0" square formed by the *outside faces* of the four main support posts. Dimension lines should indicate this 10'-0" distance on both sides.
2.  **Post Locations (4 total):** Indicate the center point of each of the four 6x6 support posts. These should be at the corners of the 10'-0" x 10'-0" square.
3.  **Post Footings:**
    *   Show a square or circular footing under each post location.
    *   **Dimensions:** Each footing to be 1'-6" x 1'-6" (18"x18") square if using square footings, or 1'-6" (18") diameter if using circular (Sonotube) footings.
    *   **Depth Note:** Annotate: "Footings to be min. 2'-6" (30") deep or below local frost line, whichever is greater. Verify depth with local codes."
    *   **Centering:** Each post should be centered on its footing.
    *   **Post Anchor:** Indicate the location for a galvanized post base (e.g., Simpson Strong-Tie ABA66Z or similar) centered on each footing, to receive the 6x6 post. Annotate: "Install galvanized post base, centered on footing, set in wet concrete."
4.  **Optional Concrete Slab (shown with dashed lines or as an alternative detail):**
    *   **Dimensions:** If a full slab is used, show it as 10'-6" x 10'-6", providing a 3" border around the 10'-0" post line on all sides.
    *   **Thickness Note:** Annotate: "Optional Concrete Slab: 4" thick, 3500 psi concrete over 4" compacted gravel base."
    *   **Reinforcement Note:** Annotate: "Reinforce slab with 6x6 W1.4xW1.4 WWF (Welded Wire Fabric) or #3 rebar at 18" o.c. each way, placed mid-depth."
    *   **Control Joints:** If slab is shown, indicate control joints. For a 10'-6" slab, one central joint in each direction would be appropriate.
5.  **Dimensioning:**
    *   Overall dimensions of the post layout (10'-0" x 10'-0" to outside of posts).
    *   Center-to-center dimensions for posts (9'-6" x 9'-6" if posts are 6" nominal, so outside to outside is 10'-0").
    *   Dimensions of footings (1'-6" x 1'-6" or 1'-6" dia).
    *   Spacing of posts from the edge of the optional slab (3" from outside face of post to slab edge).
6.  **Annotations:**
    *   "Drawing 01: Foundation Plan"
    *   Scale: 1/2" = 1'-0"
    *   North Arrow (if site orientation is known, otherwise general).
    *   Notes on concrete strength, gravel base, reinforcement, and footing depth as mentioned above.
    *   "All 6x6 posts to be centered on footings and anchored with specified post bases."

### Drawing 02: Floor Plan

**Intended Scale:** 1/2" = 1	'-0"

**Description:** This drawing shows a top-down view of the gazebo at floor level, detailing the layout of posts, railings, built-in benches, and entry points. It assumes the foundation (slab or piers) is already in place.

**Elements to Include:**

1.  **Overall Post Layout:** Show the four 6x6 support posts forming the 10	'-0" x 10	'-0" square (outside face to outside face). Clearly label each post as "6x6 PT Post".
2.  **Railings:**
    *   Show railings on three sides of the gazebo, with one side (e.g., the front) left open for entry.
    *   **Design:** Railings to consist of a solid lower panel and an open upper section, topped with a cap rail, as per reference images.
    *   **Lower Solid Panel:** Indicate a height of approx. 18"-20" from floor level. Can be shown as a solid filled area or detailed with vertical 1x6 PT boards.
    *   **Upper Open Section:** Indicate the space above the solid panel up to the underside of the top rail (approx. 14"-16" opening).
    *   **Top Rail:** Show a 2x6 PT top rail with a 5/4x6 PT cap, for an overall railing height of approx. 36" from floor level.
    *   **Bottom Rail:** Show a 2x4 PT bottom rail supporting the solid panel.
    *   Dimension the height of the top rail, the height of the solid panel, and the opening.
3.  **Built-in Benches:**
    *   Show built-in benches along the three sides that have railings.
    *   **Seat Dimensions:** Indicate bench seat depth of 1	'-6" (18") and seat height of 1	'-6" (18") from floor level.
    *   **Bench Structure:** Show the bench seat (e.g., made of 2x6 PT planks or 5/4x6 PT decking boards) and supporting framework (2x4 PT). The back of the bench can be integrated with the railing's solid panel.
    *   Clearly dimension the length of each bench section (typically running between posts, minus a small clearance).
4.  **Entry Opening:** Clearly indicate the open side for entry, typically the full width between two posts (approx. 9	'-0" clear opening if posts are 6" nominal and spaced 10	'-0" on center).
5.  **Floor Surface:** Annotate "Floor: Concrete Slab (see Dwg 01) or other approved outdoor flooring material."
6.  **Dimensioning:**
    *   Overall post layout (10	'-0" x 10	'-0" to outside of posts).
    *   Clear internal dimensions between posts (approx. 9	'-0" x 9	'-0").
    *   Width of the entry opening.
    *   Length and depth of benches.
    *   Railing section lengths.
7.  **Annotations:**
    *   "Drawing 02: Floor Plan"
    *   Scale: 1/2" = 1	'-0"
    *   Label posts, railings, benches, and entry.
    *   Reference to Foundation Plan (Dwg 01).
    *   Notes on materials for benches and railings (e.g., "All bench and railing lumber to be PT").

### Drawing 03: Roof Framing Plan

**Intended Scale:** 1/2" = 1	'-0"

**Description:** This drawing shows a top-down view of the gazebo's roof framing structure, detailing the layout of beams, hip rafters, common rafters, jack rafters, and any central support or ridge components. This view is as if looking down onto the framing before any decking is applied.

**Elements to Include:**

1.  **Support Posts (4 total):** Show the top outline of the four 6x6 PT support posts.
2.  **Beams (Headers - 4 total):**
    *   Show doubled 2x8 PT beams spanning between the tops of the support posts on all four sides.
    *   Label as "(2) 2x8 PT Beam".
    *   Indicate how they sit on/connect to the posts (e.g., resting on post caps or secured with appropriate metal connectors).
3.  **Hip Rafters (4 total):**
    *   Show 2x6 PT hip rafters extending from each corner (where beams meet over posts) upwards to a central meeting point (the peak of the hip roof).
    *   Label as "2x6 PT Hip Rafter".
    *   Indicate the angle or cut required at the beam connection and at the peak.
4.  **Common Rafters:**
    *   Show 2x6 PT common rafters running perpendicular from the center of each beam up to the corresponding hip rafter.
    *   **Spacing:** Annotate "2x6 PT Common Rafters at 16" o.c." (or 24" o.c. if design allows, but 16" is more robust for a shingled roof).
    *   Show the diminishing lengths as they approach the corners.
5.  **Jack Rafters:**
    *   Show 2x6 PT jack rafters running from the beams up to the hip rafters, parallel to the common rafters, filling in the triangular sections of the roof.
    *   **Spacing:** Annotate "2x6 PT Jack Rafters at 16" o.c." (or same as common rafters).
6.  **Central Peak Detail:**
    *   Show how the four hip rafters meet at the peak. For a simple hip, they converge to a point. A small, structurally sound block or specific connectors might be detailed here.
    *   Alternatively, if a very short ridge board is used (less common for a perfect square hip), indicate it.
7.  **Hurricane Straps/Ties:**
    *   Use symbols or callouts to indicate the location of hurricane straps (e.g., Simpson H1 or H2.5A or equivalent) at:
        *   Each rafter-to-beam connection (both common and jack rafters).
        *   Each hip rafter-to-beam connection.
        *   Each beam-to-post connection.
    *   Annotate: "Install hurricane straps as per manufacturer's specifications and local codes at all rafter/beam and beam/post connections."
8.  **Overhangs (if any):** If the roof has overhangs beyond the beams, these should be clearly dimensioned. (The reference images suggest minimal overhang, with fascia directly attached to rafter tails that are flush with or slightly beyond the beams).
9.  **Dimensioning:**
    *   Overall dimensions of the beam layout (matching the 10	'-0" x 10	'-0" post footprint).
    *   Spacing of common and jack rafters (e.g., "16" o.c.").
    *   Size of all framing members (e.g., "2x6 PT", "(2) 2x8 PT").
10. **Annotations:**
    *   "Drawing 03: Roof Framing Plan"
    *   Scale: 1/2" = 1	'-0"
    *   Roof Pitch: Annotate "Roof Pitch: 6/12" (or as determined from design).
    *   Labels for all framing members (beams, hip rafters, common rafters, jack rafters).
    *   Notes on connections and hurricane straps.
